## Data description
Impact creaters from the moon were used to pre-train the model. These creaters were digitised by NASA and are avalible from the Moon Crater Database v1 Robbins:https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Moon/Research/Craters/lunar_crater_database_robbins_2018 The database contains approximately 1.3 million lunar impact craters and is approximately complete for all craters larger than about 1â€“2 km in diameter. Craters were manually identified and measured on Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Camera (LROC) Wide-Angle Camera (WAC) images, in LRO Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) topography, SELENE Kaguya Terrain Camera (TC) images, and a merged LOLA+TC DTM.


The Moon LRO LOLA DEM 118m v1 was used as digital elevation model. This digital elevation model  is based on data from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter, an instrument on the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft. The created DEM represents more than 6.5 billion measurements gathered between July 2009 and July 2013, adjusted for consistency in the coordinate system described below, and then converted to lunar radii.
